Hi there, I'm a Ph.D. student at NYU Data Science and founder of [SimPPL](https://simppl) interested in network simulations, agent-based models, and machine learning. I use [probabilistic programming](https://pyro.ai/) and causal inference to understand interventions to limit disinformation on social networks like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook. In the past I worked on [productionizing machine learning for particle physics](https://github.com/SwapneelM/DeepJetCore/wiki), prototyping and productionizing a graph-based trending hashtag recommendation for videos, and [graph-based deep learning in physics](https://github.com/SwapneelM/TrackingNtuples)! I've also worked on ML in cybersecurity, [chatbots](https://github.com/SwapneelM/Protobot), and open-source client APIs for IoT ML pipelines. I'm an engineer at heart and a researcher by profession so I enjoy building scalable systems to tackle hard problems!

I've conceptualized and built a Google AI-backed [ML course for undergrads](https://djunicode.github.io/umlsc-2021/). I (amateur-ishly) hosted an [advanced statistics reading group](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLob0yCmJjJ3XT9DfcQ63ly79ICmgGU5bt) following [Cosma Shalizi's wonderful textbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZH9hr7UEN-kmQWXndQkPQEtlP0tUHb1a/view?usp=sharing) on the weekends and continue to mentor students doing impactful research. I was involved as a technical mentor for [the Grand Challenge at CERN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJVrD2ALLM) and the Stanford Scholar Initiative but most notably I co-founded and continue to lead a fast-growing FOSS-development + mentorship program for undergrads called [Unicode](https://djunicode.in/) which continues to help its undergrad mentees land offers from FAANG companies and Ivy League universities!

I managed to land a couple of nice internships (although it's super-sad that I couldn't do them all) and wrote a guide for students at the [undergraduate](https://medium.com/@swapneel_mehta/the-cern-openlab-internship-experience-questionnaire-included-67d995893bea) and [graduate](https://swapneelm.github.io/interview-advice-for-research-internships-in-data-science) level. I'm also working on a book about engineering education in India at the undergraduate level, hopefully coming out in 2022!
